# Comet_Planning

 A drag-and-drop interface to help UTD students plan out their 4-year coursework.

## Getting Started

This project requires a working Node.js and NPM installation.
To start, clone the repository, and then run `npm start` to launch a local development server.

Stable release: checkout [master](https://github.com/acmutd/comet_planning/tree/master)

Developer version: checkout [dev](https://github.com/acmutd/comet_planning/tree/dev)

### Initializing Firebase
To set up, go to the Firebase console and download the credientials. Paste the
body of the config into `src/firebase.config.js` in the exported block.

For example, `src/firebase-config.js` should look something like this:
```js
export default {
  // Config goes here
  apiKey: 'some_api_key',
  authDomain: 'cometplanning.firebaseapp.com',
  databaseURL: 'https://cometplanning.firebaseio.com',
  projectId: 'cometplanning',
  storageBucket: 'cometplanning.appspot.com',
  messagingSenderId: 'some_messaging_sender_id',
  appId: 'some_app_id',
};
```

Note: Changes to `src/firebase-config.js` should not be checked into source
control. To prevent accidents, the project `.gitignore` automatically ignores
changes to the file.

## How to Contribute

This project loosely uses the [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model.
There are three types of branches: `master`, which always contains complete, production-ready copies of project code, `dev`, which is guaranteed to at least be runnable on any machine (generally free of bugs), and feature branches, which are children of `dev` that are primarily used to create new features.
Here is the process to make changes to the project:

1. From `dev`, create a new feature branch. For example, `auth-signin`
2. Make commits to the feature branch.
3. When enough of the feature is complete, open a pull request to merge changes from your feature branch to `dev`. For larger features or changes to code, open a draft pull request to track changes until completion.
4. Request a review from a project contributor, and add the pull request to a project board and milestone (if applicable)
5. When a review is complete, a contributor will squash merge the feature branch into `dev`. The feature branch can then be deleted.
